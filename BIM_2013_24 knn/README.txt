compile the code by:
javac KNN_access.javac

Run the code by:
java KNN_access

Input the name of negatives file with complete path
Input the name of positives file with complete path

The output will be on console and will show:
the label of test sequence 
class of closest k numbers of nearest neighbours
and the class assigned to the test data set


the program will generate some files with extension as .tfasta but they dont hold any significance as 
my code required an extra line starting with '>' and i wasnt able to debug it
